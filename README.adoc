== The Vagrantfile*
We want to be able to build locally, with Vagrant, something strongly close to DEV, TEST and Production environments. Each VM should behave like a real host. +
In his article http://hakunin.com/six-ansible-practices[6 practices for super smooth Ansible experience] Maxim Chernyak shares some inspiring insights : +
- Make it easy to sync your hosts file with your VMs +
- Automate adding your pub key to VMs +
- Configure your ssh client +
 
After installing Vagrant, add *_vagrant-hostsupdater_* plugin to automatically add and remove hosts every time you add or destroy VMs.   +
 
[source,shell]
----
$ vagrant plugin install vagrant-hostsupdater
